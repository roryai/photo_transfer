Files sent to unsorted directories are kept in their original directories if they were not at base level.


Old:

File transfer process:
get list of file names on sd card and store in an array
pass array to method that interpolates the file name into a string of which file to be copied.

get file name and date taken
if directory for that date doesn't exist, create it
once created, or if it already exists, move the photo to that file
repeat

make dated folders
get date of each photo
  look at file
  check date
  compare date to folder names
  transfer file to correct folder
put that file in the relevant folder

current process:
  start loop
    make directory given directory to make within(destination_dir), name of directory to make(generated by method)


make month folders
  start loop
    read year from file
    check if year folder exists, make it if it doesn't
    check if month folder exists, make it if it doesn't
    put file in month folder
  end loop
end

current setup assumes all folders that photos are to be copied into exist in destination_dir, not one level down within directories within those directories
