File transfer process:

get list of file names on sd card and store in an array
pass array to method that interpolates the file name into a string of which file to be copied.

get file name and date taken
if directory for that date doesn't exist, create it
once created, or if it already exists, move the photo to that file
repeat

make dated folders
get date of each photo
  look at file
  check date
  compare date to folder names
  transfer file to correct folder
put that file in the relevant folder

current process:
  start loop
    make directory given directory to make within(computer_dir), name of directory to make(generated by method)


make month folders
  start loop
    read year from file
    check if year folder exists, make it if it doesn't
    check if month folder exists, make it if it doesn't
    put file in month folder
  end loop
end

current setup assumes all folders that photos are to be copied into exist in computer_dir, not one level down within directories within those directories

To do:
Bug fix: adding camera or comp dir via terminal
Bug fix: get_name_time_array crashes if it deals with directories before photos one level up the file tree.
Goes recursively through file structure on camera, extracting all photos.
can read file creation date when exif data is not available
How to deal with / and \ on in file path on windows and mac?
How to deal with files that have same name but are different? Make copy if size is different my >1%?

filemanager::get_fileNames- add extensions, rather than all files
output folders created to log?
create counter class?
Can cope with seeing directories on the camera.
Add note to README: on Windows, File.ctime gives date file was created, on UNIX it gives date file was last moved.

Added functions:
Prints transfer results to log file
add error handling for when files already exist

Include?
error handling for lack of exif data- send to bulk folder after prompt?
