###A program that transfers photos from a camera connected via USB.

I am creating this to practice building software that interacts with my file system and had a real world application. Eventually it will replace the default Sony software that has hundreds of features that I don't use, and is missing a couple that I would like.

Current features:

Transfers photos

Creates folders by photo date

Transfers photos into dated folders
